# Credit-Risk-Analysis
Project Description

SimpleCreditRiskModel is a small, self-contained Python project that demonstrates the basics of credit risk modeling.

The project generates a synthetic dataset of customers with features like age, income, and loan amount, then trains a logistic regression model to predict the probability of default.

Functions
1. Automatic generation of dummy customer data 
2. Logistic regression model for credit scoring
3. Model evaluation using AUC and KS statistic 

This project is designed to be simple, educational, and portfolio-ready, showing how a credit risk analyst can apply statistical modeling and evaluation techniques in Python.
